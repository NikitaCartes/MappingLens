# Changelog

Notable, externally-visible changes to the MappingLens API. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). History starts at the current release.

## [6.2]

### Changed
- `mojmap` is now the default `namespace` for the source, bytecode, and diff
  endpoints (previously `yarn`).
- `GET /api/v1/source/{version}/{className}` with no `namespace` now returns
  `mojmap` and falls back to `yarn` for versions that have no mojmap source.
  An explicit `namespace` is still served as-is (no fallback). This fixes
  `404 Source not found` on mojmap-only versions (e.g. newer snapshots).

### Added
- Source and bytecode endpoints accept dot-separated fully-qualified class
  names (`net.minecraft.commands.CommandSourceStack`) in addition to the
  slash-separated internal form (`net/minecraft/commands/CommandSourceStack`).
